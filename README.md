Overview
--------
WebBoard is a drag n' drop GUI for electronics prototyping. With WebBoard, you can create dynamic and reactive Arduino applications which can be controlled via your browser. WebBoard includes a variety of different drag and drop block components which are designed to interface with Arduino sensors and peripherals. WebBoard is built on top of [Johnny-Five](johnny-five.io/ "Johnny Five") and Socket.IO. The WebBoard interface removes much of the necessary programming associated with Arduino projects, and makes it quick and easy to create simple Browser/Arduino interactions.
